      <p>Design a simulator that calculate the net electrostatic force on the reference point charge.
        Input may be multiple point-charges and also have different placement geometry. You can
        also take the point charges in 3-D.<br><br></p>

      <p>A Coulomb is a charge which repels an equal charge of the same sign with a force of 9×109 N when the charges are one metre apart in a vacuum. Coulomb force is the conservative mutual and internal force.<br>In 1785, French physicist Charles Augustin de Coulomb coined a tangible relationship in mathematical form between two bodies that have been electrically charged. He published an equation for the force causing the bodies to attract or repel each other, which is known as Coulomb’s law or Coulomb’s inverse-square law.<br>
        According to Coulomb’s law, the force of attraction or repulsion between two charged bodies is directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. It acts along the line joining the two charges considered to be point charges.
        <br>
        Formula is : Electric Force F = K  Q<sub>1</sub>Q<sub>2</sub> / d<sup>2</sup>
        <br>Where K= 9 x 10
        <br>The Coulomb's law equation provides an accurate description of the force between two objects whenever the objects act as point charges. A charged conducting sphere interacts with other charged objects as though all of its charge were located at its center. While the charge is uniformly spread across the surface of the sphere, the center of charge can be considered to be the center of the sphere. The sphere acts as a point charge with its excess charge located at its center. Since Coulomb's law applies to point charges, the distance d in the equation is the distance between the centers of charge for both objects (not the distance between their nearest surfaces).

        <p>Enter the value of charge 1 and charge 2 in couloumbs.<br>
          Enter the coordinates of both the charges.<br>
          The electric force between the point charges and direction and the type of force -attractive or repulsive will be shown by the simulator<br>
