      <p>Logic gates are basic building blocks of digital electronics and are used in a wide variety of electronic devices and systems. Some real-life examples of logic gates include:<br>

        Computer processors: The central processing unit (CPU) of a computer uses logic gates to perform logical operations on data.<br>
        Memory devices: Memory devices such as RAM and ROM use logic gates to store and retrieve data.<br>
        Digital circuits: Logic gates are used in digital circuits to control the flow of electrical signals and to implement Boolean logic functions.<br>
        Control systems: Logic gates are used in control systems such as traffic lights, elevators, and other automation systems to make decisions and control the movement of various components.<br>
        Communication systems: Logic gates are used in communication systems such as modems and routers to process and transmit data.<br>
        Automotive industry: Logic gates are used in the automotive industry to control the various systems such as engine, braking, and lighting system<br>
        Household appliances: Logic gates are used in household appliances such as washing machines, microwave ovens, and televisions to control their functions and features.<br>
        Medical equipment: Logic gates are used in medical equipment such as imaging machines and diagnostic equipment to control their functions and process data.<br>Real-life applications of logic gates are:<br>
        NAND gates used in burglar alarms and buzzers.<br>
        They are also used in push button switches, and functioning of street lights.<br>
        AND gates used to enable/inhibit the data transfer.<br>
