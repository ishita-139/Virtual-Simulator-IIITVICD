      <p>The number system helps us in identifying the extent to which we need to limit an entity. These give us a general insight into the mathematical operations regarding the given numbers. This helps in the calculation of numbers using mathematical operations. This gives us a measure of the distance or quantity of an object. 
        <br>
        These play a significant role in helping us deal with currency. These help us in getting to the solutions of arithmetic progressions and equations. These are helpful for us in making general calculations and getting to a certain result. These help us keep up with general mathematics in daily life. 
        <br>
        Properties of the number system<br>
        The four main properties that are held by the numbers in the number system are as follows:
        <br>
        Commutative Property<br>
        This property signifies that if the position of numbers around a mathematical operation is swapped the result of that operation will still be the same. This property is held by the mathematical operation of addition and multiplication. However, the same can not be said in the case of subtraction and division. 
        <br>
        Associative Property<br>
        This property states that the result of the operation to a set of more than two numbers will stay the same regardless of the set of numbers on which the operation is applied for the first part. This property is applicable only for the mathematical operations that involve the addition and multiplication of numbers. 
        <br>
        Distributive Property<br>
        This property of the number system helps us in getting to a conclusion by expanding the expression that we are provided with. This property is applicable in the case of addition and subtraction of numbers. However, the secondary mathematical operation that is to be applied to the set of numbers needs to be multiplication. In this property, we split the numbers by expanding the given expression.
        <br>
        Identity Property<br>
        The identity property for the number system signifies that for a certain set of numbers related to the given mathematical operations, the identity of the given number will stay the same. In case of addition and subtraction, the identity property will signify the number 0. However, in the case of multiplication and division, the number will be 1.
        <br>
        Conclusion<br>
        There are four types of systems that come under the number system. These systems present different identities for a single number, but the meaning of the number in each case will remain the same. The numbers that are associated with a specific number system use a certain set of rules to be converted from one system to the other. However, all these systems follow the basic properties of the number system. These properties are commutativity, associativity, distributive and identity properties.<br><br></p>
