      <p>The Friis Equation is a mathematical formula used in the field of wireless communication engineering to calculate the power received at a receiver antenna from a transmitter antenna. The equation provides an estimate of the power received at the receiver antenna by considering the losses that occur during the propagation of the electromagnetic waves in free space. It is a widely used formula in wireless communication that relates the power transmitted from a transmitting antenna to the power received at a receiving antenna, taking into account the distance between them and other factors that affect the signal propagation. 
        <br>The Friis equation is used in various applications of wireless communication, such as radio communication, satellite communication, and wireless networking. It is used to estimate the strength of the received signal and to optimize the antenna configuration for maximum signal strength. The equation assumes free space propagation and does not take into account signal attenuation due to obstacles, reflection, and diffraction, which can have a significant impact on the actual received signal strength.<br><br></p>
